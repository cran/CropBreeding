Description: Provides tools for crop breeding analysis including Genetic Coefficient of Variation (GCV), 
        Phenotypic Coefficient of Variation (PCV), heritability, genetic advance calculations, stability 
        analysis using the Eberhart-Russell model, two-way ANOVA for genotype-environment interactions, 
        and Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis. These tools are developed
        for crop breeding research and stability evaluation under various environmental conditions.
        The methods are based on established statistical and biometrical principles.
        Refer to Eberhart and Russell (1966) <doi:10.2135/cropsci1966.0011183X000600010011x> for stability parameters,

        <ISBN:9780582243026>, and Singh and Chaudhary (1985) "Biometrical Methods in Quantitative Genetic Analysis" 
        <ISBN:9788122433764> for foundational methodologies.
